# 0.2.1

- Add support for downloads via proxy
  Adds a :proxy option to load-project and distill.

  If no proxy is specified, the proxy settings are defaulted from
  environment variables, in the same way as leiningen does.

# 0.2.0

- Add load-project, and make distill print changes
  The load-project function will read the current project.clj file's
  dependencies and load any new ones.

  The distill function now prints the dependency coordinates that are
  loaded, and separately those that are not due to conflicts.  It also now
  accepts a sequence of dependencies to load.

  The previous return behaviour of distill is available in distill*.

  Describes the :repositories option for distill in the readme, mentioning
  project-dependencies.
